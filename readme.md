#### PyChat

Simple chat app where clients comunicate with the server (via tcp or udp) or each other (via udp) using sockets. Written in python 3.8 using Tkinter for simple gui.

#### How to use

Launch server.py first and then launch clients, when clients choose their nick, they will be connected with the server and since then they can send messages or images to each other.

#### Info

App isn't polished at all - there are still small bugs and there are is a lot of functionality that could be added (like eliminating possibility of multiple users with same nick, better ui, etc.). Also, I doubt that I will come back to polish this app.
